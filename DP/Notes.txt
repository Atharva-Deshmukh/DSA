Memoization:

- Top-down approach
- Caches the results of function calls
- Recursive implementation
- Well-suited for problems with a relatively small set of inputs
- Used when the subproblems have overlapping subproblems

Tabulation: 

- Bottom-up approach
- Stores the results of subproblems in a table
- Iterative implementation
- Well-suited for problems with a large set of inputs
- Used when the subproblems do not overlap
