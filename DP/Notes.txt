Ways to perform DP

Memoization:

- Top-down approach
- Caches the results of function calls
- Recursive implementation
- Well-suited for problems with a relatively small set of inputs
- Used when the subproblems have overlapping subproblems

Tabulation: 

- Bottom-up approach
- Stores the results of subproblems in a table
- Iterative implementation
- Well-suited for problems with a large set of inputs
- Used when the subproblems do not overlap

When to use DP?
- when a problem asks u to find all the possible Ways
- or simply the best way

How to write reccurence relations?
- Try to represent the problem in terms of index (array index)
- determine what the recursion will return
- do all the stuffs as said in the problem on that index
- if count all ways is asked => sum up all stuffs at this index
- if minimum path is asked => minimum of all stuff at this index
