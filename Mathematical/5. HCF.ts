/* Way 2: Euclidean method
- Uses result: GCD(0,b) = b
- keep reducing a to 0 and when its 0, return b
- u can do a-b if(a>b) or simply (b % a)
- but when u do a-b, u need to do it if (a>b), else do b-a
- hence better to use (b % a) to avoid if else

TC: O(min(a,b)) recursion goes on till any one (minimum one) becomes 0

Reusing Stack Frame: In traditional recursive functions, each recursive call creates a new stack frame, 
consuming additional memory. However, in tail-recursive functions, the compiler or interpreter can optimize 
by reusing the current stack frame for the recursive call since the enclosing function doesn't need to preserve 
any local state after the call returns.

Replacing Stack Frames: Instead of creating a new stack frame for each recursive call, TCO replaces the current 
stack frame with the new one, effectively eliminating the need for additional stack space.

Continued Optimization: This process continues until the base case is reached, at which point the result is 
returned. Because each recursive call reuses the same stack frame, TCO prevents stack overflow errors that might 
occur with deeply nested recursive calls. This is why SC = O(1)
SC: O(1)  THIS DOES NOT happen with all the engines by the way  */
