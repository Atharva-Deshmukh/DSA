USES OF QUEUES:

- CPU resource scheduling

Deques (Double-Ended Queues)
  Browser Cache (Forward and Backward Navigation)
  Web browsers store recently visited pages in a deque.
  You can navigate backward and forward efficiently.

Circular Queues

Operating System Process Scheduling
  Round Robin Scheduling uses a circular queue to cycle through running processes.
Traffic Light System
 Traffic lights cycle through green, yellow, and red in a circular queue. 
 Each light gets its turn in a fixed sequence.

Priority Queues

Operating System Process Scheduling (Priority Scheduling)
  Higher priority tasks execute first before lower-priority tasks.
  Example: Real-time systems (air traffic control, medical systems).
Hospital Emergency Rooms (Triage System)
  Patients with critical conditions are treated first.
  Example: A heart attack patient is treated before a minor injury patient.
