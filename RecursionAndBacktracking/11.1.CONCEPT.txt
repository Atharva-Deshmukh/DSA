You use ans.push([...currentCombo]) to create a new copy of the current combination — not a reference.
If you just use ans.push(currentCombo), you're pushing a reference to the same array that keeps changing 
during backtracking.

💥 What goes wrong with ans.push(currentCombo)?

Arrays in JavaScript are reference types.

So when you do ans.push(currentCombo), all entries in ans will eventually point to the same array, 
which will be mutated during backtracking.

Final output will have repeated or wrong values, because all saved combinations refer to the same 
changing array.
