In an array of length n

Total Subarrays = (n * (n + 1)) / 2

Total Subsequences = 2 ^ n

Patterns in Sliding window problems

1. Constant size sliding window 

    Here, we calculate the first window,
    then move the window ahead by 1
    We keep the track of elements outside the window and incoming in the window

    If queue is used, we use a k length queue and we store the 
    indices in the queue

2. Longest subarray/substring where <Condition>

    This is a variable sized window pattern
    we start with a window size 1 
    l = 0 and r = 0
    we expand and shrink to check the condition
    l = shrinks the window
    r = expands the window

3. No of subarrays where <condition>
   
    pattern 3 ex:
     no of subarrays with sum = k -> Condition is constant here
     In such problems
     1 = Calculate no of subarrays with sum <= k      --> this can be solved using sliding window technique
     2 = Calculate no of subaarays with sum <= (k - 1)
     Do 1 - 2

4. Shortest/Minimum window <condition>

    This is a variable sized window pattern
    we start with a window size 1 
    l = 0 and r = 0
    Here, we try to shrink the window as much as we can
