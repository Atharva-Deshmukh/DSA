Stable sorting algorithms preserve the relative order of records with equal keys (values). 
For example, if two elements have the same key, they will appear 
in the same order in the sorted output as they did in the input.

Ex: 
Merge Sort
Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Counting Sort
Radix Sort
Bucket Sort (can be stable, depending on the implementation)

Unstable sorting algorithms may change the relative order of records with equal keys during sorting.

Ex: 
Quick Sort (in most implementations)
Heap Sort
Selection Sort
Shell Sort
