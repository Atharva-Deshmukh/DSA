Operator: It is a symbol that defines a specific action/Calculations. 
Operand: It is the data, variable, or value upon which the operator acts.

Priority order of operators:
----------------------------

Exponentiation (^) -> 1
Multiplication and division -> 2
Addition and subtraction -> 3
Anything else -> can be given -1

Types of notations:
-------------------

Infix:
    - This is the most common one that we use
    - Operators are between the operands
    - (p + q) * (m - n)
    - Used everywhere

prefix:
    - Operators are before the operands
    - * + pq - mn
    - Used in LISP programming language specifically and tries

postfix:
    - Operators are after the operands
    - pq + mn - *
    - Used in stacks based calculators

What Is Associativity?
----------------------

When two operators of the same precedence appear together,
associativity decides which one is evaluated first.

It answers this: If operators have equal priority, do we evaluate left to right or right to left?

Example: a - b - c
Since - is left associative, it becomes: (a - b) - c
Common left-associative operators: +, -, *, /, %

Right-Associative Operators -> Evaluated from right to left.
Example: a ^ b ^ c
Since ^ is right associative, it becomes: a ^ (b ^ c)
